A Data-Driven Journey into the World's Top Universities

# QS World University Rankings Analysis

Welcome to the World University Rankings Analysis repository. This project explores and analyzes data from the QS World University Rankings spanning the years 2017 to 2022. We investigate various aspects of university rankings, international student preferences, research output, and the comparison between public and private universities.

## Dataset

We used the [QS World University Rankings 2017–2022 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/padhmam/qs-world-university-rankings-2017-2022) from Kaggle. The dataset includes information on university rankings, international student numbers, research output, and more.

## Motivation
This project explores and analyzes data from the QS World University Rankings spanning the years 2017 to 2022. We investigate various aspects of university rankings, international student preferences, research output, and the comparison between public and private universities. 

Here's an overview of the analyses conducted in this project:

1. **Which Country is Preferred by International Students?**
   - We explored international student preferences across the years.

2. **What Makes a Best Ranked University?**
   - We examined the factors contributing to a university's high ranking, including research output, faculty count, and more.

3. **Primary Contributors of High Research Output**
   - We identified the primary contributors to high research output and visualized their impact.

4. **Public vs. Private Universities**
   - We compared public and private universities in terms of rankings, research output, and other factors.
